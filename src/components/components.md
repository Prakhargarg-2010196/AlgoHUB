# Nomenclature and structure of the folders in components folder

The components folder would be for generic components used all over the app.

-   Each folder would hold a separate component.
-   A big component would hold a separate folder _elements_ for describing the elements that make up that component.(Mostly would contain presentational components)
-   In some cases a utils folder shall be provided so as to make it easier for repeating logic from the components to be derived out of the app.(Can contain functions or custom hooks)
